        The Internet should be a platform for creativity, collaboration, and entertainment available to everyone. It is the only way we can feasibly shrink the world and connect with anyone because human collaboration is what benefits our world. The removal of net neutrality threatens this notion. A just Internet should not only cost the same for everyone, but in fact, should cost nothing at all. In addition to net neutrality, language, physical accessibility, and access to devices must be considered for everyone to have their right to Internet access.
