            <p>A just internet does not have privatized ownership, nor is governed by any particular organization, but is unowned. <br /> Every person has access, with free internet security and protection from malware, and freedom to regulate data privacy and restrict surveillance. <br /> The internet enables otherwise small voices, to be heard.
            &nbsp;
            There is intuitive UI design in every language and culture, as well as optimized language accessibility to oust lack of translation. <br /> It is a tool for cultivation of further learning, and furtherment of a better society. <br />The internet should make the world smaller in terms of communication and exploration.</p>
