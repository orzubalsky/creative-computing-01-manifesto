            Not long ago, the internet was solely text based. It lacked visual display, and therefore, design. </p>
            <p class='modern'>
                It wasnâ€™t until the computer program, GUI, graphical user interface, was invented that display and design were incorporated into the internet experience. 
            </p>
            <p class='display'>
                The integrations of visual display and design into the internet transformed the experience. It no longer required users to memorize programming languages, making it more user friendly. 
            </p>
