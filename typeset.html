            In a safe and secure Internet, predatory establishments/private parties who attempt to make a profit off of or harm an uninformed/unconsenting user’s private information shall face international legal repercussions, no matter where either are located.

            In a safe and secure Internet, a party’s intellectual property belongs solely to its creator and is their sole decision on how the original material is to be distributed. Other parties are allowed to make alternate versions, in which obvious changes are credited.
