                The internet can feel like home.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything and anything is accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can learn new things.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can meet new people.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can be yourself there.

                Things To Remember:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. You are a person outside of the internet.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                The internet is not home.
            </p>
            <p>
                People around you will get concerned if you spend too much time there.
            </p>
            <p>
                It can change the way you are, positively and negatively.
            </p>
            <p>
                The internet is a place you visit, not a place to live.
            </p>
