                The internet should be a place of comfort for every 


                single person and in order to achieve one major component is to be relied on, communication. As people it’s our general instinct adhere to anything that catches our interest visually and all this depends on many factors such as font choice, color, sizing, placement, etc., depending on where it is you’re going on the internet. The majority of the time when sites are being visited an appropriate amount of text is provided to give context to the site along with the appropriate font to represent the overall message being delivered. There should always be a neutral way of tending to everybody’s visual need and respect each other’s beliefs or desires.
