            <p><p align="center">A just internet does not have privatized ownership, nor is governed by any particular organization, but is unowned. </br> Every person has access, with free internet security and protection from malware, and freedom to regulate data privacy and restrict surveillance. </br> The internet enables otherwise small voices, to be heard. </p>
            <p><p align="center">There is intuitive UI design in every language and culture, as well as optimized language accessibility to oust lack of translation. </br> It is a tool for cultivation of further learning, and furtherment of a better society. </br>The internet should make the world smaller in terms of communication and exploration.</p>
